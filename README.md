# Capstone-Project
Video Games Sales Analysis and Predictive Model

Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing video game sales data and building a machine learning model to predict global sales. The dataset includes various features such as regional sales, critic scores, user scores, and more. The project applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and regression modeling to uncover key insights and make accurate predictions.

Objectives:
- Analyze trends and patterns in video game sales.
- Identify the most influential factors driving global sales.
- Build and evaluate a predictive model for global sales.

Key Features:
- Data Analysis: Visualization of regional sales and scores to understand their impact.
- Outlier Handling: Correction of extreme values to ensure data quality.
- Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical features like platform and genre.
- Model Selection: Comparison of regression algorithms to choose the best-performing model.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization of the Random Forest model for better performance.
- Pipeline Creation: Seamless preprocessing and prediction for unseen data.

Results:
- Best Model: Random Forest Regressor with an RÂ² score of 0.964, indicating excellent prediction accuracy.
- Regional sales and critic scores were identified as the most influential factors driving global sales.
